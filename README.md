Project utilizing the Giphy API

Working

- buttons displaying correctly
- gifs displaying with their ratings on button click
- each button click displays 10 gifs above the previous gifs
- first set of gifs can be clicked to animate and then clicked to stop
- added form for user to add their own buttons

Not Working
==================
- animate on click is inconsistent. it seems to work every other time I click the findGifs buttons.
- search field does not clear on submit
